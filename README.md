This app is meant for swim coaches to manage their teams, swimmers, trainings and swim meets.
You can look at the [ToDo List][1] to see what has yet been implemented and what needs to be done.

This app is not yet production ready, but if you are interested and want to check it out
I can only encourage you to do so. If you have suggestions or found a bug open a new issue
[here][2].

Right now you have to compile the app yourself but in the near future releases will be available
on the [Github Download Site][3].

If you think you can contribute to this project don't hesitate to make a pull request,
it is boring to work on a project alone :grin:
